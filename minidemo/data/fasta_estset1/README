These EST sequences of triphysaria versicolor haven been taken from
the NCBI trace archive: http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi?

They have been preprocessed so that sequencing vectors and poly-A /
poly-T bases were masked (without further checking).

To download the complete set including SCF data, use this URL:

The tvc_mini.fasta contains a 6 sequence subset of Triphysaria for
demonstration purpose on how to work with miraEST and different strain
data.
