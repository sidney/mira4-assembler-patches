MIRA version 4.x


MIRA - The Genome and EST Sequence Assembly System


This README covers aspects of the source package.

License
=======

Since version 2.8.0, MIRA (and the therein contained version of EdIt) is
licensed under the open source GPL v2 license. please consult the "COPYING"
file for more information on the GPL.


Building
========

Please consult the file "Definitive Guide to MIRA", chapter "Installation,"
for more information on pre-requisites, available options and walkthrough for
common systems. There's also a section on building documentation in the same
file.


Directory structure of the source package
=========================================

Top level (this level):
- standard files from GNU autoconf and automake as well as README; INSTALL,
  etc.
- directory "src": the MIRA sources. Type "make" to make the binaries.
- directory "doc": the MIRA documentation in DocBook format. Use "make docs"
  to build the documentation in HTML and PDF format.
- directory "distribution": type "make distrib" and a package is made that
  contains binaries, documentation and some demos
- directory "minidemo": a few demos for mira and miraEST. Please note that the
  demos are not directly usable in this directory and that one should never
  try to run mira or miraEST in that directory. The reason is that "make
  distrib" will make a complete copy of this directory
- directories "miratest" and "test": please disregard these directories, they
  just contain a few toy test cases used in development of MIRA.

For more information on the sub-directories, please consult the README files
there (if present).


Programming with MIRA
=====================

The overall code documentation is not good. While it is slowly brought up to
speed, please have a look at the files in ./src/examples_programming. And then
look at the public functions of the classes in the ./src/mira directory.
