    </para>
    <para>
      There you will normally find a couple of precompiled binaries -- usually
      for Linux and Mac OSX -- or the source package for compiling yourself.
    </para>
    <para>
      Precompiled binary packages are named in the following way:
    </para>
    <para>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  For <filename><replaceable>miraversion</replaceable></filename>, the
	  stable versions of MIRA with the general public as audience usually
	  have a version number in three parts, like
	  <filename>3.0.5</filename>, sometimes also followed by some postfix
	  like in <filename>3.2.0rc1</filename> to denote release candidate 1
	  of the 3.2.0 version of MIRA. On very rare occasions, stable
	  versions of MIRA can have four part like in, e.g.,
	  <filename>3.4.0.1</filename>: these versions create identical
	  binaries to their parent version (<filename>3.4.0</filename>) and
	  just contains fixes to the source build machinery.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The version string sometimes can have a different format:
	  <filename><emphasis>sometext</emphasis>-0-g<emphasis>somehexnumber</emphasis></filename>
	  like in, e.g.,
	  <filename>ft_fastercontig-0-g4a27c91</filename>. These versions of
	  MIRA are snapshots from the development tree of MIRA and usually
	  contain new functionality which may not be as well tested as the
	  rest of MIRA, hence contains more checks and more debugging output
	  to catch potential errors

	As of now (Feb. 2014), if you are on OSX 10.9 (Mavericks) and are
	using GCC &le; 4.8.2, the steps described above (including the prayer)
	may not be enough. If an error occurs at the linking stage very late in
	the MIRA building process, you need to patch a system file as described
	in <ulink url="http://trac.macports.org/ticket/41033"/>

	  (Feb 2014) The above may fail while installing the one or other

	The system flex <emphasis>(/usr/bin/flex)</emphasis> is too old, but the
	devel/flex package from a recent pkgsrc works fine. BSD make doesn't
	like one of the lines in <emphasis>src/progs/Makefile</emphasis>, so use GNU make instead
	(available from <emphasis>pkgsrc</emphasis> as <emphasis>devel/gmake</emphasis>). Other relevant pkgsrc packages:
	<emphasis>devel/boost-libs</emphasis>, <emphasis>devel/boost-headers</emphasis>
	and <emphasis>textproc/expat</emphasis>. The configure script has to
	be told about these pkgsrc prerequisites (they are usually rooted
	at <emphasis>/usr/pkg</emphasis> but other locations are possible):

	If attempting to build a pkgsrc package of MIRA, note that the LDFLAGS
	passed by the pkgsrc mk files don't remove the need for
	the <emphasis>--with-boost</emphasis> option.  The configure script
	complains about flex being too old, but this is harmless because it
	honours the $FLEX variable when writing out makefiles.
