      Introduction
    </title>
    <para>
      Most of this chapter and many sections are just stubs at the moment.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="sect_pd_sanger">
    <title>
      Sanger
    </title>
    <para>
      Outside MIRA: transform .ab1 to .scf, perform sequencing vector clip
      (and cloning vector clip if used), basic quality clips.
    </para>
    <para>
      Recommended program: <command>gap4</command> (or
      rather <command>pregap4</command>) from the Staden 4 package.

  <sect1 id="sect_pd_454">
    <title>
      Roche / 454
    </title>
    <para>
      Outside MIRA: convert SFF instrument from Roche to FASTQ,
      use <command>sff_extract</command> for that. In case you used
      "non-standard" sequencing procedures: clip away MIDs, clip away
      non-standard sequencing adaptors used in that project.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="sect_pd_illumina">
    <title>
      Illumina
    </title>
    <para>
      Outside MIRA: for heavens' sake: do NOT try to clip or trim by quality
      yourself. Do NOT try to remove standard sequencing adaptors
      yourself. Just leave Illumina data alone! (really, I mean it).
    </para>
    <para>
      MIRA is much, much better at that job than you will probably ever get
      ... and I dare to say that MIRA is better at that job than 99% of all
      clipping/trimming software existing out there. Just make sure you use
      the <arg>-CL:pec</arg> (proposed_end_clip) option of MIRA.
    </para>
    <note>
      The <emphasis>only</emphasis> exception to the above is if you (or your
      sequencing provider) used decidedly non-standard sequencing
      adaptors. Then it might be worthwhile to perform own adaptor
      clipping. But this will not be the case for 99% of all sequencing
      projects out there.
    </note>
    <para>
      Joining paired-ends: if you want to do this, feel free to use any tool
      which is out there (TODO: quick list). Just make sure they do not join
      on very short overlaps. For me, the minimum overlap is at least 17
      bases.

    <title>
      Pacific Biosciences

      Outside MIRA: MIRA needs error corrected reads, either
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	PacBio CCS reads (circular consensus sequence) which you get from the
	PacBio SMRTAnalysis pipeline

	or self-corrected or reads corrected with other sequencing
	technologies which you will get either from the PacBio HGAP pipeline
	or the pacbioToCA pipeline

    <para>
      Assembly of uncorrected PacBio reads (CLR) is currently not supported
      officially as of MIRA 4.0.

  <sect1 id="sect_pd_iontor">
    <title>
      Ion Torrent
    </title>
    <para>
      Outside MIRA: need to convert BAM to FASTQ. Need to clip away
      non-standard sequencing adaptors if used in that project. Apart from
      that: leave the data alone.
